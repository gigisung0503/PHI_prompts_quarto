## Available Prompts

<!-- ### System Design

:::{.callout-tip title="System Evaluation"}
[**Surveillance System Evaluation**](system-evaluation.qmd)

Systematic evaluation of public health surveillance systems using CDC guidelines and standardized performance attributes.

**Complexity:** Advanced | **Tags:** surveillance evaluation, system performance, CDC guidelines, data quality, system design
::: -->

## Getting Started

1. **Define surveillance objectives** clearly and specifically
2. **Identify target conditions** and populations for monitoring
3. **Consider available resources** and infrastructure
4. **Select appropriate evaluation framework** based on system maturity

## Best Practices

- Follow established surveillance guidelines (CDC, WHO)
- Ensure system objectives align with public health priorities
- Plan for regular evaluation and improvement
- Include stakeholder engagement from the beginning
- Consider legal and ethical requirements for data collection
- Build in flexibility for changing health threats
- Document system operations and procedures clearly


## Prompts

### 1. Using an URL Summarizer Application Prompt

```markdown

Go through the below list of URLs one by one. 

For each URL: If the page cannot be opened, record the error received (e.g., "Page not found," "Access denied," etc.). 
If the page opens successfully, analyze the content and produce a WHO-style epidemiological summary following the structure below.

- WHO Epidemiological Summary Instructions:  As a WHO epidemiologist, describe the information in the article in English using the following structured format, but present the final output as a cohesive narrative in paragraph form (no bullet points or lists). Distinguish each section clearly using labeled headings.

- Time: Specify the time of the event, including the time window of reported cases. If unavailable, state the date of the report. Place: Identify the exact location (district, region, department) and situate it within the country (north, south, east, west). If near a border, mention the neighboring country.

- Person: Provide the number of cases (suspected, probable, and laboratory-confirmed, if available). Include numbers of severe cases requiring hospitalization and any reported deaths. 

- Exposure/Source: Describe the suspected or confirmed source/route of exposure, and any contributing environmental or social factors. 

- Historical Context: Add background or historical data from trusted sources (e.g., previous outbreaks, seasonal trends, endemicity, or vaccination coverage). 

- Actions Taken: Summarize actions underway (e.g., “Monitoring,” “Coordinating with national authorities,” “Shared with RO & Technical Team”). 

- Unknowns: Clearly state what is not yet known (e.g., missing clinical details, laboratory confirmation, epidemiological links, or historical context).
