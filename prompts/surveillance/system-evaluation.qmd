## Prompt

You are a surveillance system specialist tasked with evaluating the performance and effectiveness of a public health surveillance system. Help me conduct a comprehensive evaluation using CDC guidelines.

**Surveillance System Details:**
- System name: [SPECIFY SYSTEM NAME]
- Disease/condition monitored: [SPECIFY CONDITIONS]
- Geographic coverage: [LOCAL/STATE/NATIONAL]
- Duration of operation: [TIME PERIOD]
- Reporting sources: [LIST DATA SOURCES]

**Please evaluate the following attributes:**

### 1. Simplicity
- Assess ease of operation and maintenance
- Evaluate data collection and reporting processes
- Identify opportunities for simplification

### 2. Flexibility
- Evaluate ability to adapt to changing information needs
- Assess responsiveness to new health threats
- Review system modification capabilities

### 3. Data Quality
- Assess completeness, accuracy, and timeliness
- Evaluate data validation procedures
- Identify data quality improvement opportunities

### 4. Acceptability
- Evaluate stakeholder willingness to participate
- Assess reporting compliance and engagement
- Identify barriers to participation

### 5. Sensitivity
- Estimate ability to detect cases/events
- Assess coverage of target population
- Evaluate case detection effectiveness

### 6. Predictive Value Positive (PPV)
- Assess proportion of reported cases that are true cases
- Evaluate case verification processes
- Identify false positive reduction strategies

### 7. Representativeness
- Evaluate how well system describes disease occurrence
- Assess population coverage and geographic representation
- Identify potential biases in reporting

### 8. Timeliness
- Assess speed of case detection and reporting
- Evaluate time from onset to public health action
- Identify bottlenecks and improvement opportunities

### 9. Stability
- Assess system reliability and consistency
- Evaluate resource availability and sustainability
- Review operational continuity

**System Context:** [Provide details about system objectives, resources, legal framework, and operational environment]
