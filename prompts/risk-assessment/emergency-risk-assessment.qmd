- Estimate overall risk level (low/moderate/high/very high)
- Quantify potential health impacts (morbidity/mortality)
- Identify key uncertainties and data gaps

### 5. Risk Management Recommendations
- Prioritize immediate response actions
- Suggest prevention and mitigation strategies
- Recommend resource allocation priorities
