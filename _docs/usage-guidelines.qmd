This document provides detailed guidance on how to effectively use the Public Health Intelligence Prompts Library.

## Getting Maximum Value

### Before Using Prompts

1. **Define Your Objective**: Clearly understand what you want to achieve
2. **Select Appropriate Category**: Choose the most relevant prompt category
3. **Review Multiple Options**: Compare similar prompts to find the best fit
4. **Understand Context**: Read the full prompt description and usage notes

### Customizing Prompts

#### Essential Customization Steps

1. **Replace Placeholders**: Fill in all bracketed variables with specific information
2. **Add Context**: Include relevant background information for your situation
3. **Specify Constraints**: Add any limitations, requirements, or special considerations
4. **Define Output Format**: Clarify how you want results presented

#### Example Customization

**Original Prompt:**
```
Analyze health data for [DISEASE] in [LOCATION] during [TIME_PERIOD]
```

**Customized Prompt:**
```
Analyze health data for influenza in New York County during January-March 2024, 
focusing on age-specific attack rates and geographic clustering. The dataset 
includes 1,247 confirmed cases with complete demographic information.
```

### Working with AI Assistants

#### Prompt Engineering Tips

1. **Be Specific**: Provide concrete details rather than general statements
2. **Use Context**: Give AI relevant background information
3. **Set Expectations**: Clearly state what type of output you need
4. **Iterate**: Refine prompts based on initial responses
5. **Validate**: Always verify AI outputs with domain expertise

#### Common Improvements

- **Add Role Definition**: "You are an experienced epidemiologist..."
- **Specify Format**: "Provide results in a structured report with sections for..."
- **Include Examples**: "Similar to the format used in CDC reports..."
- **Set Boundaries**: "Focus only on [specific aspects]..."

## Domain-Specific Guidance

### Epidemiology
- Include case definitions when relevant
- Specify population demographics
- Provide temporal and geographic scope
- Mention data sources and quality

### Surveillance
- Define surveillance objectives
- Specify target conditions or events
- Include population coverage details
- Mention reporting requirements

### Data Analysis
- Describe dataset characteristics
- Specify analysis objectives
- Include variable definitions
- Mention software preferences

### Risk Assessment
- Define the specific threat or hazard
- Include population characteristics
- Specify assessment framework
- Mention regulatory requirements

## Quality Assurance

### Validating AI Outputs

1. **Subject Matter Review**: Have domain experts review results
2. **Cross-Reference**: Compare with established guidelines and literature
3. **Plausibility Check**: Ensure recommendations are feasible and appropriate
4. **Bias Assessment**: Look for potential biases in analysis or recommendations

### Common Issues to Watch For

- **Outdated Information**: AI may use outdated practices or guidelines
- **Context Misunderstanding**: AI might miss important contextual factors
- **Overgeneralization**: Results may need local adaptation
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure outputs meet current requirements

## Best Practices

### Documentation
- Keep records of prompts used and outputs generated
- Document any modifications made to prompts
- Track which prompts work best for different scenarios
- Share successful adaptations with the community

### Collaboration
- Involve multidisciplinary teams in prompt selection and review
- Share prompts and improvements with colleagues
- Contribute back to the library with tested improvements
- Participate in community discussions

### Continuous Improvement
- Regularly update prompts based on new evidence
- Adapt prompts for local contexts and requirements
- Test prompts with different AI models for consistency
- Provide feedback to maintainers

## Troubleshooting

### Common Problems and Solutions

:::{.callout-tip title="Problem: AI output is too general or vague"}
**Solution**: Add more specific context and constraints to the prompt
:::

:::{.callout-tip title="Problem: Output doesn't match public health standards"}
**Solution**: Include specific guidelines or frameworks in the prompt
:::

:::{.callout-tip title="Problem: Analysis seems inappropriate for the data"}
**Solution**: Provide more detailed data characteristics in the prompt
:::

:::{.callout-tip title="Problem: Recommendations aren't actionable"}
**Solution**: Specify the decision-making context and available resources
:::

## Advanced Techniques

### Prompt Chaining
Use multiple prompts in sequence to build complex analyses:
1. Start with exploratory data analysis prompt
2. Follow with specific statistical testing prompt
3. Conclude with interpretation and recommendations prompt

### Context Building
Gradually build context across multiple interactions:
1. Establish the scenario and objectives
2. Add data characteristics and constraints  
3. Specify analysis requirements
4. Request interpretation and recommendations

### Template Customization
Create organization-specific versions of prompts that include:
- Local reporting requirements
- Specific data sources and formats
- Organizational terminology and procedures
- Regulatory compliance requirements
