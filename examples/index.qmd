## Example Overview

This section provides comprehensive examples of how to use the Public Health Intelligence Prompts Library in real-world scenarios. Each example demonstrates the complete workflow from prompt selection to implementation.

## Available Examples

### [Foodborne Illness Investigation](foodborne-illness-investigation.qmd)

A complete step-by-step example demonstrating how to use multiple prompts from the library to conduct a foodborne illness outbreak investigation.

**What you'll learn:**
- How to select appropriate prompts for your use case
- Step-by-step prompt customization process
- Integration of multiple prompt outputs
- Best practices for real-world implementation

**Prompts demonstrated:**
- Outbreak Investigation Analysis (Epidemiology)
- Emergency Risk Assessment (Risk Assessment)  
- Weekly Surveillance Report (Reporting)

## How to Use These Examples

### For New Users
1. **Start here** to understand the library's practical applications
2. **Follow the workflows** to see complete implementation processes
3. **Adapt the examples** to your specific contexts and needs

### For Experienced Users
- **Reference implementations** for complex multi-prompt workflows
- **Best practice demonstrations** for quality assurance
- **Template workflows** for similar scenarios

## Example Categories

### Investigation Workflows
- Outbreak investigation processes
- Case study development
- Multi-agency coordination examples

### Reporting Workflows  
- Regular surveillance reporting
- Emergency communication protocols
- Policy briefing development

### Analysis Workflows
- Statistical analysis planning
- Risk assessment procedures
- Data quality evaluation

## Contributing Examples

We welcome examples from the public health community! 

### What Makes a Good Example
- **Complete workflow** from start to finish
- **Real-world relevance** (using anonymized/fictional data)
- **Multiple prompt integration** when applicable
- **Clear documentation** of decision points
- **Lessons learned** and best practices
